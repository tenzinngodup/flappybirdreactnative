The user is asking me to create a PRD (Product Requirements Document) prompt for a Flappy Bird-style game built with Expo and React Native. Let me break down what this should include:

1. Overview of the game concept
2. Key features
3. Technical requirements
4. Visual/UI requirements
5. Game mechanics
6. Scoring system
7. Restart functionality

I'll create a comprehensive PRD prompt that someone could use to build this game.

# Product Requirements Document: Flappy Bird Clone for Expo/React Native

## Overview
Create a simple Flappy Bird-inspired mobile game using Expo with React Native. The game should be single-player with appealing visuals, score tracking, and game restart functionality.

## Core Requirements

### Game Mechanics
- A bird character that responds to screen taps by flapping upward
- Scrolling pipes that appear randomly from the right side of the screen
- Gravity effect that pulls the bird downward when not flapping
- Collision detection between the bird and pipes/ground/ceiling
- Score increments each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes

### Visual Elements
- Clean, appealing 2D graphics with a cohesive style
- Animated bird character with flapping animation
- Scrolling background to create movement effect
- Visual feedback for game events (collisions, scoring)
- Day/night or simple environmental theme

### User Interface
- Start screen with game title and "Tap to Start" prompt
- In-game score display (current score prominently shown during gameplay)
- Game over screen displaying final score
- "Restart" button on the game over screen
- Optional: Best score tracking (local storage)

### Technical Requirements
- Built with Expo and React Native
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Smooth animations (minimum 30 FPS)
- Touch controls optimized for mobile
- Asset optimization for performance

## Constraints
- Keep the implementation simple but functional
- No multiplayer functionality required
- No complex features like power-ups or different levels
- Focus on core gameplay loop and making it fun

## Deliverables
- Fully functional Expo/React Native application
- All necessary game assets (sprites, backgrounds)
- Clean, well-documented code
- Instructions for running the application

This Flappy Bird clone should capture the addictive simplicity of the original game while providing a clean implementation using modern React Native practices.
